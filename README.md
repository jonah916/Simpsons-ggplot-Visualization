# Simpsons-ggplot-Visualization
A bar plot displaying the viewership and ratings of seasons of "The Simpsons" over time. While the data set I used contained the viewership and ratings of each episode, I organized them by season to display the more general trends, namely that both viewership and ratings have decreased over time.
